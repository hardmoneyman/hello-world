# hello-world

Old newbie here, I am hear to learn as I find myself (many times per day) saying I don't understand what that means, when dealing with many of the systems I am using daily. 
Podio has become my "go to" CMS" for the last 6 months and I have gone down the rabit hole of making integrations with other systems like Twilio and Globiflow and Rightsignature that all require some code knowledge. I keep seeing reference to Github in the forums so Here I am expanding my horizons. 
Or So I hope.
