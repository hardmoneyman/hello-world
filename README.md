# hello-world

Old newbie here, I am hear to learn as I find myself (many times per day) saying I don't understand what that means, when dealing with many of the systems I am using daily. 
Podio has become my "go to" CMS" for the last 6 months and I have gone down the rabit hole of making integrations with other systems like Twilio and Globiflow and Rightsignature that all require some code knowledge. 
I keep seeing reference to Github in the forums so...
Here I am hopeful about expanding my horizons. 
For many years my motto has been 
"Will those who say it cannot be done, Please stop interupting those of us who are doing it"
